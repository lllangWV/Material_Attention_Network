# Material Attention Network

Material Attention Network is a Python package designed for the prediction of materials properties using advanced transformer models. This package efficiently handles materials structure and composition data, providing a robust framework for materials science research and development.

## Features

- **Transformer-based Models:** Leverage the power of transformers for accurate prediction of materials properties.
- **Materials Structure and Composition Input:** Designed to work with various forms of material data including structural and compositional information.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and accuracy, ensuring quick and reliable predictions.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be easily integrated into existing materials science workflows.

## Installation

To install Material Attention Network, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install matattnet
```

# Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use Material Attention Network:

```python
from material_attention_network import MaterialAttentionModel

# Initialize the model
model = MaterialAttentionModel()

# Input your material's structure or composition
material_data = 'YOUR_MATERIAL_DATA'

# Predict properties
predicted_properties = model.predict(material_data)
print(predicted_properties)
```

Replace 'YOUR_MATERIAL_DATA' with your actual materials data.
